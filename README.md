A optimization class assignment written in GAMS

GAMS is a common optimization software. Its syntax is awful because of strict rules, and it is easy to forget. Thus I wrote this class assignment in GAMS and put it in Github for future reference.

**Problem Statement:** refer to **problem.pdf**. 

On the other hand, this problem could benefit my parents since they are feeding chicken, ducks and gooses in my hometown, while few people including my parents have senses about optimization in the rural area in China. Even though they really care about this realistic problem, they lack enough knowledge and scientific estimation tool so that rough estimation would affect the actual income. It happens all the time.
